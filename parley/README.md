Parley provides an API for implementing rich text layout.
It is backed by [Swash](https://github.com/dfrg/swash).

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Parley has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.75** and later.

Future versions of Parley might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

As time has passed, some of Parley's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
