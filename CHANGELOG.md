# Changelog

The latest published Parley release is [0.4.0](#040---2025-05-08) which was released on 2025-05-08.
You can find its changes [documented below](#040---2025-05-08).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV] of 1.82.

### Added

#### Parley

- Editor features required by Android IME. ([#334][] by [@mwcampbell][]

### Changed

#### Parley

- Breaking change: `Layout::min_content_width`, `Layout::max_content_width`, and `Layout::content_widths` have been replaced with `Layout::calculate_content_widths`, which does not internally cache the widths. This means that `Layout` is now `Sync` again, but callers will have to cache the min and max content widths themselves. ([#353][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Breaking change: the line height style property (`StyleProperty::LineHeight` and the `line_height` field on `TextStyle`) is now a `LineHeight` enum that allows you to specify absolute, font-size-relative, and font-metrics-relative line heights.
  Previously, it was always font-size-relative. ([#362][] by [@valadaptive][])
  - The default line height was previously `LineHeight::FontSizeRelative(1.0)` if you used `RangedStyleBuilder`, or `LineHeight::FontSizeRelative(1.2)` if you used `TreeStyleBuilder`.
    It is now `LineHeight::MetricsRelative(1.0)` in both cases.
    This will affect layout if you don't specify your own line height.
- Breaking change: `{RangedBuilder, TreeBuilder}::{build_into, build}` methods now consume `self`. ([#369][] by [@dhardy][])

### Fixed

## [0.4.0] - 2025-05-08

This release has an [MSRV] of 1.82.

### Migration

Quantization of vertical layout metrics is now optional.
For an easy upgrade we recommend enabling it by setting `quantize` to `true` when calling [`LayoutContext::ranged_builder`](https://docs.rs/parley/0.4.0/parley/struct.LayoutContext.html#method.ranged_builder) or [`LayoutContext::tree_builder`](https://docs.rs/parley/0.4.0/parley/struct.LayoutContext.html#method.tree_builder).

### Added

#### Parley

- Option to skip quantization of vertical layout metrics for advanced rendering use cases. ([#297][] by [@valadaptive][], [#344][] by [@xStrom][])
- The `WordBreak` and `OverflowWrap` style properties for controlling line wrapping. ([#315][] by [@valadaptive][])
- `PlainEditor` methods `raw_selection` and `raw_text`. ([#316][], [#317][] by [@mwcampbell][])
- `PlainEditor::selection_geometry_with`, the equivalent of `Selection::geometry_with` method. ([#318][] by [@valadaptive][])
- `BreakLines::is_done` method to check if all the text has been placed into lines. ([#319][] by [@valadaptive][])

### Changed

#### Parley

- Breaking change: `Selection::geometry`, `Selection::geometry_with`, and `PlainEditor::selection_geometry` now include the line indices that the selection rectangles belong to. ([#318][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Updated to `accesskit` 0.19. ([#294][] by [@waywardmonkeys][], [#348][] by [@xStrom][])
- Now displaying selected newlines as whitespace in the selection highlight. ([#296][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Made `BreakReason` public. ([#300][] by [@valadaptive][])

#### Fontique

- Breaking change: `Collection::register_fonts` now takes a `Blob<u8>` instead of a `Vec<u8>`. ([#306][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Breaking change: `Collection::register_fonts` now takes an optional second parameter which allows overriding the metadata used for matching the font. ([#312][] by [@valadaptive][])

### Fixed

#### Parley

- Text editing for layouts which contain inline boxes. ([#299][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Cursor navigation in RTL text sometimes getting stuck within a line. ([#331][] by [@valadaptive][])
- Using `Layout::align` on an aligned layout without breaking lines again. ([#342][] by [@xStrom][])
- Selection box height going below ascent + descent with small line heights. ([#344][] by [@xStrom][])
- Rounding error accumulation of vertical layout metrics. ([#344][] by [@xStrom][])

#### Fontique

- Panic on macOS when running in debug mode. ([#335][] by [@NoahR02][])

## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-27

- Breaking change: `PlainEditor`'s width is now `Option<f32>` rather than `f32`. ([#137][] by [@nicoburns][])
- Breaking change: Make alignment when free space is negative configurable. ([#241][] by [@nicoburns][])
- Allow Bidi `base_level` to be determined from text. ([#245][] by [@tomcur][])
