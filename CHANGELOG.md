# Changelog

The latest published Parley release is [0.2.0](#020---2024-10-10) which was released on 2024-10-10.
You can find its changes [documented below](#020---2024-10-10).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV] of 1.82.

### Added

#### Fontique

- `FontStretch`, `FontStyle`, and `FontWeight` get helper functions `from_fontconfig` ([#212][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

#### Parley

- `Generation` on `PlainEditor` to help implement lazy drawing. ([#143] by [@xorgy])
- Support for preedit for input methods in `PlainEditor` ([#192][], [#198][] by [@tomcur][])
- `PlainEditor` method to get a cursor area for use by the platform's input method ([#224][] by [@tomcur][])
- `Layout` methods to calculate minimum and maximum content widths. ([#259][] by [@wfdewith][])

### Changed

#### Fontique

- Breaking change: `Stretch`, `Style`, and `Weight` renamed to `FontWidth`, `FontStyle`, `FontWeight` ([#211][], [#223][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

#### Parley

- Breaking change: `PlainEditor`'s semantics are no longer transactional ([#192][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Breaking change: `Alignment::Start` and `Alignment::End` now depend on text base direction.
  `Alignment::Left` and `Alignment::Right` are introduced for text direction-independent alignment. ([#250][] by [@tomcur][])
- Breaking change: `Layout` is no longer `Sync`. ([#259][] by [@wfdewith][])
- Breaking change: `Layout::align` now takes `AlignmentOptions` and requires `container_width` to be set.
  Consider setting `container_width` to the value used for line breaking.
  To keep the old default behavior, set `container_width` to the value returned by `Layout::width`.
  ([#278][] by [@nicoburns][], [#283][] by [@tomcur][])

### Fixed

#### Parley

- Fix alignment of right-to-left text. ([#250][], [#268][] by [@tomcur][])
- Performing line breaking or aligning a layout again, after justified alignment had been applied previously, now lead to the correct results. ([#271][] by [@tomcur][])

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-10

This release has an [MSRV] of 1.75.

### Added

#### Parley

- Example using tiny-skia which renders into a png ([#55] by [@nicoburns])
    - Breaking change: There is now a blanket implementation for `Brush`.
- A swash example which renders into a png ([#54] by [@nicoburns])
- An example with Vello on Winit which shows a basic text editor ([#106] by [@dfrg])
- `PlainEditor`, a basic action-based text editor based on Parley `Selection` and `Cursor` ([#126] by [@xorgy])
- Tree style builder ([#76] by [@nicoburns])
- Conversions for `FontFamily`, `FontStack`, and `StyleProperty` to make styling more ergonomic ([#129] by [@xorgy])

### Changed

#### General

- Repository layout updated to match Linebender standard ([#59] by [@waywardmonkeys])

#### Parley

- Emoji clusters now get an Emoji family added by default ([#56] by [@dfrg])
- Style builders now accept `Into<StyleProperty<'a, B: Brush>>` so you can push a `GenericFamily` or `FontStack` directly. ([#129] by [@xorgy])

#### Fontique

- Removed unsafe code from fontconfig cache ([#78] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Switched to `windows-rs` for `dwrite` backend ([#85] by [@dfrg])

### Fixed

#### Fontique

- Search correct paths for fonts on Apple platforms ([#71] by [@waywardmonkeys])

### Removed

#### Fontique

- Breaking change: removed conversion to/from `icu_properties::Script` for `fontique::Script` ([#72] by [@waywardmonkeys])
    - This can be restored by using the `icu_properties` feature of `fontique`.
