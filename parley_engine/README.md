Parley Engine provides low level APIs for shaping paragraphs of text.

## Usage

Use [`Analyzer`], [`Analysis`], [`Shaper`] and [`ShapedText`] to shape a paragraph of text into
glyphs. Correct reshaping of lines is in progress; in the meantime you can break text at
[`Atom`] or [`ShapedCluster`][crate::shape::ShapedCluster] boundaries.

Text analysis is performed before shaping, and the same source string must be passed to each
stage.

Higher-level users may prefer using [`parley`][parley], which uses this crate and implements
layout and styling.

```rust
let mut analysis = Analysis::default();
let mut analyzer = Analyzer::default();
let mut shaped_text = ShapedText::default();
let mut shaper = Shaper::default();

let text = "The quick brown ثعلب jumps over the lazy dog.";
let char_count = text.chars().count();
let char_style_indices = vec![0; char_count];

analyzer.analyze(text, &AnalysisOptions::default(), &mut analysis);
shaper.shape_text(
    text,
    &analysis,
    &char_style_indices,
    [Item {
        char_end: char_count.try_into().unwrap(),
        options: ShapeOptions {
            font_size: 16.0,
            language: None,
            features: &[],
            variations: &[],
        },
     }],
     select_font, // Selects fonts covering each cluster.
     &mut shaped_text,
);

for (run_idx, run) in shaped_text.runs().iter().enumerate() {
    let slice = shaped_text.run_slice(run_idx as u32);
    // You can, for example, measure grapheme advances for hit-testing or
    // placing carets.
    for atom in slice.atoms_start() {
        for grapheme in atom.graphemes_start() {
            std::dbg!(grapheme);
        }
    }

    // Or get glyphs for rendering (for simplicity, this iterates clusters in
    // logical order, but for rendering you'd want to reorder runs and clusters
    // according to their `run.bidi_level`).
    for cluster in slice.shaped_clusters_range() {
        for glyph in slice.shaped_cluster_glyphs(cluster) {
            std::dbg!(glyph);
        }
    }
}
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Parley Engine has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.88** and later.

Future versions of Parley Engine might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<details>
<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of Parley Engine's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
