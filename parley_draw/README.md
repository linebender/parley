## Parley Draw 

Parley Draw provides APIs for efficiently rendering glyphs and paint styles like underline.

### Goals

Parley Draw is under rapid development. Consider it experimental for now. Its goals are to:

- Provide an API surface that accepts glyphs and their positions and renders them to a surface.
- Cache those glyphs so that repeated renders of a glyph are fast.
- Support rendering paint styles like underline, strikethrough, and brush color.
- Share expensive structs and data between the shaper and renderer like the hinting instance and hinted advance.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Parley has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.83** and later.

Future versions of Parley might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
